# HoneySens-Legacy
This repository contains version both server and sensor software for HoneySens 0.2.5. The server is based on PHP5 and can be built using the Grunt task runner. To create a BeagleBone sensor image, please rely on the official image build scripts of the BeagleBone project and integrate the sensor scripts manually. Further documentation on installation and usage of this software is available under `sensor/docs`.

**Note:** This repository is just an archive and superseded by the [HoneySens Community Edition](https://github.com/sylencecc/honeysens-ce).
